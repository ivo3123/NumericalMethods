# NumericalMethods

This repository contains materials from the elective course Numerical Methods, Sofia University, faculty of mathematics and informatics, year 2023-2024.

Most files are .ipynb (Jupyter notebook files) to show interactivity.

The directory `utils/` contains all the algorithms taught in this course.

### Usage

I recommend using VSCode and the Jupyter Notebook extension.
Clone this repository.
Reuse the numerical methods in the ./utils/ directory.

Note that ./utils/\_\_pycache\_\_ directory is created to store compiled modules for better performance. This directory is automatically managed when executing code from notebooks.
